# Paperless-Scan

This was mainly used to start to learn PyWinAuto. I wrote this script and then launch it with a batch file from a stream deck. This allows me to scan things and put them in Paperless's consume directory quickly while I do other things. Works well when your printer does not have a scan to network option.
